## Read 83: The Prompt Report, a systematic survey of reporting techniques, by @sanderschulhoff, Ilie et al

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06608

The authors of this paper make a very dense review of all prompting techniques, from the basics to the more complex ones.

The study goes beyond simple English prompting, and goes as well over multilingual and multimodal prompting.

It discusses as well pairing LM prompting with external tools, and different kind of operational agents that exist with referenced methods.

Lastly, it goes over issues with prompting, how to benchmark different prompts and goes over a case study for how to approach as a prompt engineer a difficult real world problem.

Personal Thoughts: Paper is a complete read over the different techniques at the moment, and quite the interesting read or refresher when it comes to prompting. A read I recommend!
