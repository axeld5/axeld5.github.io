## Building a React Blog with GitHub Pages

A step-by-step guide to creating a modern blog using React and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

In this post, I'll walk through the process of creating a modern blog using React and deploying it to GitHub Pages.

### Getting Started

First, I set up a new React application and configured routing for multiple pages. The key components include:

- Navigation system with React Router
- Responsive design with modern CSS
- Dev mode for easy content creation

### Key Features

- **Multi-page navigation**: About, Papers, and Blog sections
- **Dev mode**: For writing content on the go
- **Responsive design**: Works on all devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean and professional appearance

### Deployment

Deploying to GitHub Pages is straightforward with the gh-pages package. The key is to configure the build process correctly and ensure all routes work properly.

This approach gives us a clean, maintainable blog that scales well and integrates perfectly with our development workflow.
