## Experimenting with Web APIs

Exploring modern web APIs and their potential for creating interactive applications.

Modern browsers provide a wealth of APIs that can make web applications more interactive and powerful.

### APIs Explored

- **Geolocation API**: For location-based features
- **Notification API**: For user notifications  
- **File API**: For file handling
- **Canvas API**: For graphics and visualizations

### Implementation Details

Each API has its own quirks and browser support considerations. The key is to implement progressive enhancement so that features gracefully degrade on older browsers.

### Results

The experiments showed promising results for creating rich, interactive experiences without requiring heavy frameworks or external dependencies.
