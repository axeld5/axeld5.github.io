## Read 17: Social Skill Training with Large Language Model, by @diyi_yang et al from Stanford University

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04204.pdf

Not a technical paper for once, but more one that explores the following: what if AI could help us increase our social skills?

The authors explore in this paper the possibility and the use cases of having:
- An AI mentor, which is supposed to provide one feedback.
- An AI partner, which is supposed to expose the learner to targeted practices

They explore several social skill clusters in which the APAM (AI Partner AI Mentor) framework could be useful, as a way to train novices in order to acquire new skills, like Active Listening or Rhetoric. They also discuss already existing APAM solutions, like CARE or GPTeach.

They then present use case modules for both the AP and AM agents, as some sort of graduating continuum: from the rubber duck to a standardized partner; from the conversational summarizers into structured feedback givers.

They also note the technical challenges, which are:
- Getting memory for long-term interaction with a trainee
- Giving expertise to the chosen LM
- Giving user a degree of control over the trainings they want to follow
- Personalization of the training so that they are tailor made to the learner

All those are effective challenges, that need to be resolved for such a system. They then discuss how to evaluate APAM, both qualitatively and quantitatively, both short term and long term.

They conclude by looking into both positive and negative social impacts solutions implementing an APAM could have, to lastly recommend that such a solution should mainly be human-centered.

Personal Thoughts: Interesting as a concept, and interesting to cover a more down-to-earth kind of paper. I feel a bit curious personally towards this approach. I do feel like an LLM companion could not reproduce having a real mentor or a real partner one can trust and rely on, but it can still be of value and give useful advice one could have not thought of by themselves. It is a promising area to explore, and I can’t wait to see what’s next!
